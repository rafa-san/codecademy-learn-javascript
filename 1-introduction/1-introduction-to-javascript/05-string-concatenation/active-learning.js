/*
Instructions

1. Inside a console.log() statement, concatenate the two strings 'Hello' and 'World'.

Note: You should concatenate the two strings exactly (without introducing any additional characters).


2. We left off the space last time. Create a second console.log() statement in which you concatenate the strings 'Hello' and 'World', but this time make sure to also include a space (' ') between the two words.

// #1
console.log('Hello' + 'World');

// #2
