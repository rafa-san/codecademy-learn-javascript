Instructions

1. Use the .toUpperCase() method to log the string 'Codecademy' to the console in all capital letters.


2. In the second console.log() statement in app.js, we have a string ' Remove whitespace ' which has spaces before and after the words 'Remove whitespace'.

If we browse the JavaScript string documentation, we find several built-in string methods that each accomplish a different goal. The one method that seems ideal for us is .trim().

Use the method to remove the whitespace at the beginning and end of the string in the second console.log() statement.

// Use .toUpperCase() to log 'Codecademy' in all uppercase letters
console.log('Codecademy'.toUpperCase());

// Use a string method to log the following string without whitespace at the beginning and end of it.
console.log('    Remove whitespace   '.trim());
