/*
Instructions:

1. Inside of a console.log(), add 3.5 to your age.

This is the age you’ll be when we start sending people to live on Mars.


2. On a new line write another console.log(). Inside the parentheses, take the current year and subtract 1969.

The answer is how many years it’s been since the 1969 moon landing.


3. Create another console.log(). Inside the parentheses divide 65 by 240.


4. Create one last console.log(). Inside the parentheses, multiply 0.2708 by 100.

That’s the percent of the sun that is made up of helium. Assuming we could stand on the sun, we’d all sound like chipmunks!
