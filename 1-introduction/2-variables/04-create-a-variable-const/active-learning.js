Instructions

1. Create a constant variable named entree and set it to equal to the string 'Enchiladas'.


2. Just to check that you’ve saved the value of 'Enchiladas' to entree, log the value of entree to the console.


3. Great, let’s see what happens if you try to reassign a constant variable.

Paste the following code to the bottom of your program.

| entree = 'Tacos';

This code throws the following error when you run your code:

| TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

const entree = 'Enchiladas';
console.log(entree);

// entree = 'Tacos';
