Instructions

1. Use console.log() to print the typeof newVariable.


2. Great, now letâ€™s check what happens if we reassign the variable. Below the console.log() statement, reassign newVariable to 1.


3. Since you assigned this new value to newVariable, it has a new type! On the line below your reassignment, use console.log() to print typeof newVariable again.

let newVariable = 'Playing around with typeof.';
console.log(typeof newVariable);

newVariable = 1;
console.log(typeof newVariable);
