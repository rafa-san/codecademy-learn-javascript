Instructions

1. Make a for loop that loops backwards printing 3 to 0 to the console. Use the >= comparison operator in your stopping condition and the -- operator in your iteration statement.

// The loop below loops from 0 to 3. Edit it to loop backwards from 3 to 0
for (let counter = 0; counter < 4; counter++){
  console.log(counter);
}
*/

// The loop below loops from 0 to 3. Edit it to loop backwards from 3 to 0
for (let counter = 3; counter >= 0; counter--){
  console.log(counter);
}
