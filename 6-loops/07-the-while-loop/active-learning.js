Instructions

1. Below the cards array, declare a variable, currentCard, with the let keyword but don’t assign it a value.


2. Create a while loop with a condition that checks if the currentCard does not have that value 'spade'.

Inside the block of your while loop, add the following line of code:

| currentCard = cards[Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)];

Math.floor(Math.random() * 4) will give us a random number from 0 to 3. We’ll use this number to index the cards array, and assign the value of currentCard to a random element from that array.


3. Awesome! Your loop is running, but you can’t tell because it doesn’t output anything. Let’s add a console.log() statement to our while block. Inside the block, after you assign currentCard a new value, log currentCard to the console.

For fun you can run your code a few times and see how the output changes!

***

const cards = ['diamond', 'spade', 'heart', 'club'];

// Write your code below
*/

const cards = ['diamond', 'spade', 'heart', 'club'];

// Write your code below

let currentCard;

while (currentCard !== 'spade') {
  currentCard = cards[Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)];
  console.log(currentCard);
}
