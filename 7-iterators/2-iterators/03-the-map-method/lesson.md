# Iterators

## The .map() Method
The second iterator we’re going to cover is .map(). When .map() is called on an array, it takes an argument of a callback function and returns a new array! Take a look at an example of calling .map():

| const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; 
| 
| const bigNumbers = numbers.map(number => {
|   return number * 10;
| });

.map() works in a similar manner to .forEach() — the major difference is that .map() returns a new array.

In the example above:

- numbers is an array of numbers.
- bigNumbers will store the return value of calling .map() on numbers.
- numbers.map will iterate through each element in the numbers array and pass the element into the callback function.
- return number * 10 is the code we wish to execute upon each element in the array. This will save each value from the numbers array, multiplied by 10, to a new array.

If we take a look at numbers and bigNumbers:

| console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
| console.log(bigNumbers); // Output: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

Notice that the elements in numbers were not altered and bigNumbers is a new array.
