Instructions

1. The spaceship we have so far looks good but, unfortunately, is not very fast at hyperspace travel due to having an inferior fuel source. Make a new spaceship object named fasterShip with the same color as spaceship but with a Fuel Type equal to 'Turbo Fuel'.
*/

// Write your fasterShip object literal below
const fasterShip = {
  color: "silver",
  "Fuel Type": "Turbo Fuel",
}
