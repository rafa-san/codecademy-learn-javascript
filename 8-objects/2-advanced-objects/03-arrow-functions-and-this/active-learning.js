Instructions

1. Currently the .checkEnergy() method is not producing the correct output because it is using arrow function syntax.

Refactor, or change, the method to use a function expression. You can write the function using either longhand or shorthand format.

After refactoring the method, notice that .checkEnergy() has access to the other internal properties of the robot object.

HINT:
You can use the ES6 shorthand:

const goat = {
  name: 'Billy',
  color: 'biege',
  giveDetails(){
    console.log(`${this.name} is a ${this.color} goat.`)
  }
}

Or the longhand format:

const goat = {
  name: 'Billy',
  color: 'biege',
  giveDetails: function() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is a ${this.color} goat.`)
  }
}

=====

const robot = {
  energyLevel: 100,
  checkEnergy: () => {
    console.log(`Energy is currently at ${this.energyLevel}%.`)
  }
}

robot.checkEnergy();
*/

const robot = {
  energyLevel: 100,
  checkEnergy() {
    console.log(`Energy is currently at ${this.energyLevel}%.`);
  },
};

robot.checkEnergy();
