Instructions

1. Let’s create a new object to practice using this.

In main.js there is an object robot, add a property of model and assign to it a value of '1E78V2'. Add another property, energyLevel and assign to it a value of 100.

To add a property, you’re adding another key-value pair to an object. Remember to separate the properties by a comma.


2. Inside the robot object, add a method named provideInfo. Inside the body of provideInfo(), return the following string by using interpolation:

I am MODEL and my current energy level is ENERGYLEVEL.  

Replace ‘MODEL’ and ‘ENERGYLEVEL’ with the calling object’s model and energyLevel property. Remember, to get the access to the calling object’s properties inside a method, you have to use the this keyword!


3. Now to check .provideInfo() has access to the internal properties of robot. Log the result of calling .provideInfo() method on robot to the console.

=====

const robot = {
  
};
*/

const robot = {
  model: "1E78V2",
  energyLevel: 100,
  provideInfo() {
    return `I am ${this.model} and my current energy level is ${this.energyLevel}.`;
  },
};

console.log(robot.provideInfo());
