Instructions

1. Imagine that you manage an online store. When a customer places an order, you send them a thank you note. Letâ€™s create a function to complete this task:

Define a function called sayThanks() as a function declaration.
In the function body of sayThanks(), add code such that the function writes the following thank you message to the console when called: 'Thank you for your purchase! We appreciate your business.'


2. Call sayThanks() to view the thank you message in the console.


3. Functions can be called as many times as you need them.

Imagine that three customers placed an order and you wanted to send each of them a thank you message. Update your code to call sayThanks() three times.

function sayThanks() {
  console.log('Thank you for your purchase! We appreciate your business.');
}

sayThanks();
sayThanks();
