Instructions

1. Change the value of wordCount so that it is truthy. This value should still be a number.

After you make this change and run your code, 'Great! You've started your work!' should log to the console.


2. Change the value of favoritePhrase so that it is still a string but falsy.

After you make this change and run your code, 'This string is definitely empty.' should log to the console.

let wordCount = 0;

if (wordCount) {
  console.log("Great! You've started your work!");
} else {
  console.log('Better get to work!');
}


let favoritePhrase = 'Hello World!';

if (favoritePhrase) {
  console.log("This string doesn't seem to be empty.");
} else {
  console.log('This string is definitely empty.');
}
