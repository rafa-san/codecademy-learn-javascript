/*
Instructions

1. Using let, create a variable named hungerLevel and set it equal to 7.


2. Write an if...else statement using a comparison operator. The condition should check if hungerLevel is greater than 7. If so, the conditional statement should log, 'Time to eat!'. Otherwise, it should log 'We can eat later!'.

After you press run, play around with the condition by tweaking the comparison of hungerLevel by using different operators such as <=,>=,>, and <.

let hungerLevel = 7;

if (hungerLevel > 7) {
  console.log('Time to eat!');
} else {
  console.log('We can eat later!');
}
